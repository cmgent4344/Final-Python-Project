# Final-Python-Project
This is my final project for 3200K Python Programming
# Summary
Ever play Guess that number? Well now you can play a game similar to that with Christmas Movies in this new game that I created. This game is played by guessing either the name of a movie that is randomly generated each time you play or by guessing a attribute of that movie.
# What is it
I created a Christmas movie guessing game that uses the movies attributes as part of the guessing process that returns either a yes or no to each guess.
# Why did i do it (real world app)
I chose to create this game because Ihave not seen any coding games that acutally was related to Christmas and I wanted to make some code that would go along with the Holiday season. 
# How (libraries, tools)
The first part of creating this code was to import the random function so the movie selection for each play through would be different. the second part in this creation was to create a dictionary of 10 diffrent Christmas movies along with a list of different attributes for each movie in the dictionary. Once the Dictonary was created i had to created a code that wopuld actually use the imported random function and in order to do that I had to use the enumerate funtion number the items in the dictionary so the random function will work.
