# Final-Python-Project
This is my final project for 3200K Python Programming
# Summary
Ever play Guess that number? Well now you can play a game similar to that with Christmas Movies in this new game that I created. This game is played by guessing either the name of a movie that is randomly generated each time you play or by guessing a attribute of that movie.
# What is it
I created a Christmas movie guessing game that uses the movies attributes as part of the guessing process that returns either a yes or no to each guess.
# Why did i do it (real world app)
I chose to create this game because Ihave not seen any coding games that acutally was related to Christmas and I wanted to make some code that would go along with the Holiday season. 
# How (libraries, tools)
The first part of creating this code was to import the random function so the movie selection for each play through would be different. the second part in this creation was to create a dictionary of 10 different Christmas movies along with a list of different keys for each movie in the dictionary. Once the Dictonary was created i had to created a code that would actually use the imported random function and in order to do that I had to use the enumerate funtion number the items in the dictionary so the random function will work. The creation of the while loop was the next step and the main part of the code that makes the game work.
# Usage/Example
Once the game begins your are asked "What Christmas movie am I thinking of?" you start gueesing the name or attribute of a Christmas movie. For example if i typed in buddy as a attribute the code will respond either yes thats from the movie im thinking of or no try again. If it yes then you would say the name of the movie which in this case is Elf and then you would recieve a message saying that you won the game.
